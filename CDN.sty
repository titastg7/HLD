Content Delivery Network (CDN) involves creating a system that delivers content 
(e.g., images, videos, documents) to users efficiently and reliably,
 regardless of their geographic location.

1. System Requirements
--------------------------------
Efficient delivery of static content.
Low latency and high availability.
Scalability to handle large numbers of requests.
Load balancing and redundancy.
Logging and monitoring for performance metrics.
Security features to protect content and users.


2. Components
--------------------------------
Origin Server: The server where the original content is stored.
Edge Servers (CDN Nodes): Distributed servers that cache and deliver content to users.
DNS Load Balancer: Directs users to the nearest edge server.
Content Replication: Mechanism to replicate content from the origin server to edge servers.
Monitoring and Analytics: Tools to monitor performance, usage, and detect anomalies.
Security Measures: SSL/TLS encryption, DDoS protection, and access control

4. Detailed Design
--------------------------------
    Origin Server
        Stores the master copy of all content.
        Syncs updates with edge servers.
    Edge Servers (CDN Nodes)
        Located strategically around the globe to be closer to end-users.
        Cache content to reduce load on the origin server and decrease latency.
        Implement cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used).
    DNS Load Balancer
        Routes user requests to the nearest or most optimal edge server based on factors like geographic location, server load, and network conditions.
        Uses techniques like Anycast routing for efficient request distribution.
    Content Replication
        Proactively replicates popular content to edge servers.
        Uses pull or push methods for replication:
            Pull: Edge servers request content from the origin server when needed.
            Push: Origin server pushes content updates to edge servers.
    Monitoring and Analytics
        Collects data on request latency, cache hit/miss rates, and server load.
        Detects and alerts on performance issues or failures.
    Security Measures
        SSL/TLS: Ensures secure content delivery.
        DDoS Protection: Detects and mitigates distributed denial-of-service attacks.
        Access Control: Restricts access to authorized users.

5. Scalability and Redundancy
--------------------------------
    Horizontal Scaling: Add more edge servers as demand increases.
    Redundancy: Deploy multiple edge servers in each region to ensure high availability.
    Failover Mechanisms: Redirect traffic to operational servers in case of failures.

6. Implementation Considerations
--------------------------------
    Content Invalidation: Mechanism to invalidate cached content when updates occur.
    Log Management: Centralized logging for monitoring and debugging.
    APIs: Provide APIs for content upload, cache management, and analytics.
7. Example Scenarios
    Cache Miss: A user requests a file that is not in the edge server cache. The edge server fetches it from the origin server, caches it, and serves it to the user.
    Cache Hit: A user requests a file that is already cached in the edge server. The edge server serves the content directly, resulting in lower latency.
